# distributions
We use machine learning to verify and predict the solution distribution of some simple polynomial equations defined over a finite field.

## Conclusions

We enumerated rational points on a hyperelliptic curve over a large range of finite fields and verified Sato-Tate conjecture by Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test from statistics. Along the way, we also applied machine learning techniques ranging from Linear regression, gradient boosting Decision tree to Neural networks.
